We are using MongoDB as it is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.

## Run Instructions

To start the server, run `npm start` in your command line

## Application Details

### User Story

    AS A social media startup
    I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
    SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

### Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN a social network API
    WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
    THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
    WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
    THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
    WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
    WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
    THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user‚Äôs friend list

### API Routes

#### Users

| Feature          | Routes                                             |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| Add User         | `POST` http://localhost:3001/api/users             |
| Get All Users    | `GET` http://localhost:3001/api/users              |
| Get Single Users | `GET` http://localhost:3001/api/users/{user_id}    |
| Update User      | `PUT` http://localhost:3001/api/users/{user_id}    |
| Delete User      | `DELETE` http://localhost:3001/api/users/{user_id} |

\*\* When you delete user, all thoughts associated with that users will also be deleted.

User Create Sample request body:

```Json
{
    "username": "kp2",
    "email":"kptest2@test.com"
}
```

User Create Sample response body:

```Json
{
	"username": "kp2",
	"email": "kptest2@test.com",
	"thoughts": [],
	"friends": [],
	"_id": "62450a0caf20e63bafed687f",
	"__v": 0,
	"friendCount": 0
}
```

#### Friends

Another user can be linked as a friend
| Feature | Routes |
| :--- | :--- |
| Add Friend | `POST` http://localhost:3001/api/users/{user_id}/friends/{friends_user_id} |
| Remove Friend | `DELETE` http://localhost:3001/api/users/{user_id}/friends/{friends_user_id} |

Sample response when friend is added: You will see friend and friend count for that user. This will also be reflected in get user response.

```Json
{
	"_id": "62450a0caf20e63bafed687f",
	"username": "kp2",
	"email": "updatedKp@test.com",
	"thoughts": [
		"62450aa9af20e63bafed6884",
		"62450aafaf20e63bafed6887"
	],
	"friends": [
		"62450a05af20e63bafed687d"
	],
	"__v": 0,
	"friendCount": 1
}
```

#### Thoughts

User can share their thoughts with below routes:
| Feature | Routes |

| Update Thought | `PUT` http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/{thought_id}|
| Delete User | `DELETE` http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/{thought_id} |

Create Thought request sample

	"username": "krupali",
	"userId":"62450a0caf20e63bafed687f"
}
```

Create Thought response sample after it is associated to user:

```Json
{
	"_id": "62450a0caf20e63bafed687f",
	"username": "kp2",
	"email": "updatedKp@test.com",
	"thoughts": [
		"62450aa9af20e63bafed6884"
	],

Get Thoughts response sample:

```Json

}
```

Add reaction response sample: All associated response for that thought will be returned

```Json
{
	"_id": "62450aa9af20e63bafed6884",
